Potato chips in Japan are being sold for 6X their normal price.**This is after the country‘s main manufacturer stopped sales due to a potato shortage.** Storms and floods and its main potato growing region last year caused the worst harvest and more than 3 decades. Local media reports suggest Calbee and its main rival Koike-ya are halting almost 50 products.
