Among the reasons for the slower service， today there are more choices on the menu， **(4)and the products themselves are more complex and take longer to prepare。** Speed， of course， is essential to the drive through experience，and drive throughs are hugely important to chains such as MacDonalds， Burger King， and Tucle Bell。 Usually， the drive through accounts for sixty to seventy percent of all business that goes through a fast food restaurant， notes Sam Ochers， editor of QSR。 Of course， consumers also want their orders prepare correctly and on that score， Ochers says accuracy is still really high。
