Why do some people live to be older than others? You know the standard explanations: keeping a moderate diet, engaging in regular exercise, etc. But what effect does your personality have on your longevity (长寿)? Do some kinds of personalities lead to longer lives? A new study in the Journal of American Geriatrics Society looked at this question by examining the personality characteristics of 246 children of people who had lived to be at least 100.

The study shows that those living the longest are more outgoing, more active and less neurotic(神经质的)than other people. Long-living women are also more likely to be sympathetic and cooperative than women with a normal life span. These findings are in agreement with what you would expect from the evolutionary theory: those who like to make friends and help others can gather enough resources to make it through tough times.

Interestingly, however, other characteristics that you might consider advantageous had no impact on whether study participants were likely to live longer. Those who were more self-disciplined, for instance, were no more likely to live to be very old. Also, being open to new ideas had no relationship to long life, which might explain all those bad-tempered old people who are fixed in their ways.

Whether you can successfully change your personality as an adult is the subject of a longstanding psychological debate. But the new paper suggests that if you want long life, you should strive to be as outgoing as possible.

Unfortunately, another recent study shows that your mother's personality may also help determine your longevity. That study looked at nearly 28,000 Norwegian mothers and found that those moms who were more anxious, depressed and angry were more likely to feed their kids unhealthy diets. Patterns of childhood eating can be hard to break when we're adults, which may mean that kids of depressed moms end up dying younger.

Personality isn't destiny (命运), and everyone knows that individuals can learn to change. But both studies show that long life isn't just a matter of your physical health but of your mental health.



51. The aim of the study in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society is ____.

A) to see whether people's personality affects their life span

B) to find out if one's lifestyle has any effect on their health

C) to investigate the role of exercise in living a long life

D) to examine all the factors contributing to longevity



52. What does the author imply about outgoing and sympathetic people?       

A) They have a good understanding of evolution.

B) They are better at negotiating an agreement.

C) They generally appear more resourceful.

D) They are more likely to get over hardship.



53. What finding of the study might prove somewhat out of our expectation?

A) Easy-going people can also live a relatively long life.

B) Personality characteristics that prove advantageous actually vary with times.

C) Such personality characteristics as self-discipline have no effect on longevity.

D) Readiness to accept new ideas helps one enjoy longevity.



54. What does the recent study of Norwegian mothers show?

A) Children's personality characteristics are invariably determined by their mothers.

B) People with unhealthy eating habits are likely to die sooner.

C) Mothers' influence on children may last longer than fathers'.

D) Mothers' negative personality characteristics may affect their children's life spans.



55. What can we learn from the findings of the two new studies?

A) Anxiety and depression more often than not cut short one's life span.

B) Longevity results from a combination of mental and physical health.

C) Personality plays a decisive role in how healthy one is.

D) Health is in large part related to one's lifestyle.

为什么有些人比其他人活得更久？你知道标准的解释：保持适度的饮食，经常锻炼等等。但是你的个性对你的长寿有什么影响？某些性格会导致更长的生命吗？ “美国老年病学会杂志”的一项新研究通过246名至少活到100岁的人的孩子的人格特征来研究这个问题。

研究表明，长寿的人比其他人更外向，更活跃，更少神经质。与正常寿命的女性相比，长寿女性更有可能是富有同情心和善于合作的。这些发现与您对进化理论的期望是一致的：那些喜欢结交朋友并帮助他人的人可以收集足够的资源来度过难关。

然而，有趣的是，您可能认为有优势的其他性格特征对研究参与者是否可能活得更长没有影响。例如，那些更加自律的人不太可能活得很老。此外，对新想法持开放态度与长寿没有任何关系，这可能解释了所有那些脾气暴躁的老人以他们固定的方式生活。

你是否能够成功地改变成年人的性格是一个长期的心理辩论的主题。但新论文表明，如果你想要长寿，你应该努力尽可能的外向。

不幸的是，最近的另一项研究表明，你母亲的性格也可能有助于决定你的长寿。这项研究调查了近28,000名挪威母亲，发现那些焦虑，抑郁和愤怒的妈妈更有可能为孩子喂不健康的饮食。当我们成年时，儿童饮食的模式很难打破，这可能意味着抑郁的妈妈的孩子最终会在更年轻时逝去。

人格不是命运，每个人都知道个人可以学会改变。但是这两项研究表明，长寿不仅仅是你身体健康的问题，还是你的心理健康问题。
