①When we talk about Americans barely into adulthood who are saddled with unbearable levels of debt, the conversation is almost always about student loan debt. But there’s a growing body of evidence suggesting that today’s young adults are also drowning in credit-card debt—and that many of them will take this debt to their graves.

②More than 20% overspent their income by more than $100 every single month. Since they haven’t their credit histories yet, it’s a safe bet that these young adults are paying relatively high interest rates on the resulting credit card debt.

③Although many young people blame “socializing” as a barrier to saving money, most of them aren’t knocking back $20 drinks in trendy (时尚的) lounges. They’re struggling with much more daily financial demands.

④To a disturbingly large extent, the young and the broke are relying on credit cards to make it until their next payday. This obviously isn’t sustainable in the long run, and it’s going to put a huge drag on their spending power even after they reach their peak earning years, because they’ll still be paying interest on that bottle of orange juice or box of spaghetti (意式面条) they bought a decade earlier.

⑤A new study out of Ohio State University found that young adults are accumulating credit card debt at a more rapid rate than other age groups, and that they’re slower at paying it off. “If what we found continues to hold true, we may have more elderly people with substantial financial problems in the future,” warns Lucia Dunn, professor of economics at Ohio State. “If our findings persist, we may be faced with a financial crisis among elderly people who can’t pay off their credit cards.”

⑥Dunn says a lot of these young people are never going to get out from under their credit card debt. “Many people are borrowing on credit cards so heavily that payoff rates at these levels are not sufficient to recover their credit card debt by the end of their life, which could have loss implications for the credit card issuing banks.”

(61)当我们谈论那些刚刚步入成年而义负债累累的美同人的时候,我们的谈话内容几乎全部是学生 的贷款。但是,越来越多的证据显示,今天的年轻人也陷人了信用卡债务的泥潭之中 很多人将会把这个债务直接带进坟墓。

超过20%的人每个月会超支100多美元。(62)因为他们还没有建立起信用记录,但可以肯定的是, 这些年轻人在为产生的信用卡债务支付相对较高的利息。

尽管很多年轻人责备"社交"是阻碍他们存钱的一个因素,但是他们大多数人并没有在时尚的酒吧豪 饮20美元的酒，而是在与更多的日常开支作斗争。

(63) 令人不安的是，年轻人和身无分文的人在很大程度上都依赖信用来维持生计，直到下次发工资。从长远看,这样的做法很明显不会长久,会严重影响他们的购买力，即使是赚钱最多的时候,因为他们仍然 在为早在十年前买的那瓶橙汁或那盒意大利面条支付利息。

(64) 俄亥俄州立大学的一项新研究发现,与其他的年龄群体相比,年轻人积累信用卡债务的速度要更快,而他们的偿还能力比较弱。俄亥俄州立大学的经济学教授Luda Dunn警告说如果我们的发现仍然被证明是正确的话,我们将来可能会有更多的老人面临巨大的财务问题,那些不能偿还信用卡的老年人可能会面临财务危机。"

(65) Dunn说,这些年轻人中的许多人永远也无法从信用卡债务中走出来。"很多人从信用卡里大量地借钱,但按照他们的偿还能力，到死也不足以偿还信用卡债务，这将潜在地导致信用卡签发银行的损失"。
