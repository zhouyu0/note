#### 原文

①Alex Pang's amusing new book The Distraction Addiction addresses those of us who feel panic without a cellphone or computer. And that, he claims, is pretty much all of us. When we're not online, where we spend four months annually, we're engaged in the stressful work of trying to get online.

②The Distraction Addiction is not framed as a self-help book. It's a thoughtful examination of the danger of our computing overdose and a historical overview of how technological advances change consciousness. A "professional futurist", Pang urges an approach which he calls "contemplative (沉思的) computing." He asks that you pay full attention to "how your mind and body interact with computers and how your attention and creativity are influenced by technology."

③Pang's first job is to free you from common misconception that doing two things at once allows you to get more done. What is commonly called multitasking is, in fact, switch-tasking, and its harmful effects on productivity are well documented. Pang doesn't advocate returning to a preinternet world. Instead, he asks you to "take a more ecological (生态的) view of your relationships with technologies and look for ways devices or media may be making specific tasks easier or faster but at the same time making your work and life harder."

④The Distraction Addiction is particularly fascinating on how technologies have changed certain field of labor—often for the worse. For architects, computer-aided design has become essential but in some ways has cheapened the design process. As one architect puts it, "Architecture is first and foremost about thinking... and drawing is a more productive way of thinking" than computer-aided design. Somewhat less amusing are Pang's solutions for kicking the Internet habit. He recommends the usual behavior-modification approaches, familiar to anyone who has completed a quit-smoking program. Keep logs to study your online profile and decide what you can knock out, download a program like Freedom that locks you out of your browser, or take a "digital Sabbath (安息日)" ; "Unless you're a reporter or emergency-department doctor, you'll discover that your world doesn't fall apart when you go offline."

#### 翻译

Alex Pang的新书The Distraction Addiction很有趣，书中讲的是那些离开手机或电脑就感到恐慌的人。他声称，这就是我们所有人。我们每年花四个月的时间上网，我们不是在上网，就在努力上网的路上。

The Distraction Addiction不是一本励志类图书。这是对我们过度使用电脑的危害的深入审视，以及技术进步如何改变意识的历史性概述。作为一名“专业的未来主义者”，Pang呼吁采取一条他称之为“沉思的计算”的方法。他要求我们充分注意“思想和身体如何与计算机互动以及人的注意力和创造力如何受到技术的影响”。

庞的第一份工作就是让你摆脱常见的误解，即一次做两件事可以让你做得更多。事实上，通常所谓的多任务处理是切换任务，其对生产力的有害影响已有详细记录。庞并不主张回归前互联网时代。相反，他要求你“用更生态的视角看待人和技术之间的关系，并寻找设备或媒体可能使特定任务更容易或更快，但同时使你的工作和生活变得更加困难的方式。”

The Distraction Addiction特别引人注目的部分是技术如何改变某些劳动领域 - 往往更糟。对于建筑师来说，计算机辅助设计已经变得至关重要，但在某些方面已经在某种程度上贬低了设计过程的价值。正如一位建筑师所说，“建筑首先是思考......而绘图是一种比计算机辅助设计更有效的思维方式”。 Pang对戒除互联网习惯的解决方案有点不那么有趣。他建议采用通常的行为矫正方法，对于完成戒烟计划的人来说，这是很熟悉的。保留日志以研究您的在线资料并决定您可以删除的内容，下载一个类似“自由”的程序来锁住你的浏览器，或者使用“数字安息日”; “除非你是记者或急诊科医生，否则当你下线时，你会发现你的世界不会崩溃。”
