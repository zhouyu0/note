　　Everybody sleeps,but what people stay up late to catch—or wake up early in order not to miss—varies by culture.

   From data collected,it seems the things that cause us to lose the most sleep,on average, are sporting events,time changes,and holidays.

　　Around the world, people changed sleep patterns thanks to the start or end of daylight savings time. Russians, for example, began to wake up about a half-hour later each day after President Vladimir Putin shifted the country permanently to “winter time”starting on October 26.

　　Russia’s other late nights and early mornings generally correspond to public holidays. On New Year’s Eve, Russians have the world’s latest bedtime, hitting the hay at around 3:30 am.

　　Russians also get up an hour later on International Women’s Day, the day for treating and celebrating female relatives.

　　Similarly, Americans’ late nights late mornings, and longest sleeps fall on three-day weekends.

　　Canada got the least sleep of the year the night it beat Sweden in the Olympic hockey(冰球)final.

　　The World Cup is also chiefly responsible for sleep deprivation(剥夺), The worst night for sleep in the U.K. was the night of the England-Italy match on June 14. Brits stayed up a half-hour later to watch it, and then they woke up earlier than usual the next morning thanks to summer nights, the phenomenon in which the sun barely sets in northern countries in the summertime. That was nothing, though, compared to Germans, Italians, and the French, who stayed up around an hour and a half later on various days throughout the summer to watch the Cup.

It should be made clear that not everyone has a device to record their sleep patterns, in some of these nations, it’s likely that only the richest people do. And people who elect to track their sleep may try to get more sleep than the average person. Even if that’s the case, though, the above findings are still striking, If the most health-conscious among us have such deep swings in our shut-eye levels throughout the year, how much sleep are the rest of us losing?

#### 翻译

1.每个人都在睡觉，但是人们为了不错过而熬夜或早醒，都因文化而异。

2.从收集到的数据来看，似乎导致我们失去最多睡眠的事情是体育赛事，时间变化和假期。

3.由于夏令时的开始或结束，人们改变了睡眠模式。例如，在总统弗拉基米尔·普京（Vladimir Putin）于10月26日开始将该国永久性地转移到“冬季时间”后，俄罗斯人每天大约比从前晚半小时醒来。

4.俄罗斯的其他深夜和清晨通常对应公众假期。在新年前夜，俄罗斯人有世界上最晚的就寝时间，凌晨3:30左右睡觉。

5.俄罗斯人也会在国际妇女节晚起一小时，这是招待和庆祝女性亲属的日子。

同样地，美国人晚睡晚起，最长的睡眠在三天的周末。

7.加拿大人在奥运会冰球决赛中击败瑞典的那一晚获得了最少的睡眠。

8.世界杯也是剥夺睡眠的主要原因，英国最糟糕的睡眠之夜是6月14日英格兰 - 意大利比赛之夜。英国人熬夜半小时观看，然后他们在第二天早上比往常更早醒来，这要归功于夏令时。在夏季，太阳几乎没有出现在北方国家。然而，与德国人，意大利人和法国人相比，这并不算什么，他们在整个夏天的不同日子里熬了大约一个半小时才观看杯赛。

9.应该明确的是，不是每个人都有记录睡眠模式的设备，在其中一些国家，很可能只有最富有的人才会这样做。选择跟踪睡眠的人可能会试图比普通人睡得更多。尽管情况确实如此，但上述发现仍然引人注目，如果我们中最有健康意识的人全年闭眼水平有这么大的波动，我们其他人会失去多少睡眠？
