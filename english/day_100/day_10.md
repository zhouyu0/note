①Children are a delight. They are our future. But sadly, hiring someone to take care of them while you go to work is getting more expensive by the year.

②Earlier this month, it was reported that the cost of enrolling an infant or small kid at a childcare center rose 3% in 2012, faster than the overall cost of living. There are now large strips of the country where daycare for an infant costs more than a tenth of the average married couple's income.

③This is not necessarily a new trend, but it is a somewhat puzzling one. The price of professional childcare has been rising since the 1980s. Yet during that time, pay for professional childcare workers has stood still. Actually caregivers make less today, in real terms, than they did in 1990. Considering that labor costs are responsible for up to 80% of a daycare center's expenses, one would expect flat wages to have meant flat prices.

④So who's to blame for higher childcare costs?

⑤Childcare is a carefully regulated industry. States lay down rules about how many children each employee is allowed to watch over, the space care centers need per child, and other minute details. And the stricter the regulations, the higher the costs. If it has to hire a caregiver for every two children, it can't really achieve any economies of scale on labor to save money when other expenses go up. In Massachusetts, where childcare centers must hire one teacher for every three infants, the price of care averaged more than $16,000 per year. In Mississippi, where centers must hire one teacher for every five infants, the price of care averaged less than $5,000.

⑥Unfortunately, I don't have all the daycare-center regulations handy. But I wouldn't be surprised if as the rules have become more elaborate, prices have risen. The tradeoff (交换) might be worth it in some cases; after all, the health and safety of children should probably come before cheap service. But certainly, it doesn't seem to be an accident that some of the cheapest daycare available is in the least regulated South.

#### 参考翻译：

①有孩子是件乐事。他们是我们的未来。但遗憾的是，在你上班的同时雇用某人来照顾他们，其费用这一年会变得更加昂贵。

②据报道，本月早些时候，2012年儿童保育中心的婴儿或小孩入学费用增长了3％，高于整体生活费用的上涨速度。现在这个国家的大多数地区，婴儿的日托费用是已婚夫妇平均收入的十分之一。

③这不一定是一种新趋势，但它有点令人费解。自20世纪80年代以来，专业儿童保育的价格一直在上涨。然而在那段时间里，专业儿童保育工作者的工资一直停滞不前。实际上，照顾者今天的实际收入低于1990年。考虑到劳动力成本占日托中心费用的80％，人们可以预期工资水平持平意味着价格持平。

④那么谁该为上涨的儿童保育价格负责呢？

⑤儿童保育是一个受到严格监管的行业。各州制定了关于每位员工允许看护的子女数量，每个孩子需要护理中心的空间以及其他细节的规定。规则越严格，成本越高。如果必须为每两个孩子雇用一名看护人，那么当其他费用上涨时，它无法真正实现任何规模经济效益以节省资金。在马萨诸塞州，儿童保育中心必须为每三个婴儿雇用一名教师，每年平均护理费用超过16,000美元。在密西西比州，每5个婴儿中心必须雇用一名教师，护理费用平均低于5,000美元。

⑥不幸的是，我没有所有日托中心的规定。但是，如果规则变得更加精细，价格会上涨，我也不会感到惊讶。在某些情况下，交换可能是值得的；毕竟，儿童的健康和安全应该在廉价服务之前进行。但当然，一些最便宜的托儿服务在最不受监管的南方，似乎并不是偶然的。
