①If you think a high-factor sunscreen (防晒霜)keeps you safe from harmful rays, you may be wrong. Research in this week's Nature shows that while factor 50 reduces the number of melanomas(黑瘤)and delays their occurrence, it can't prevent them. Melanomas are the most aggressive skin cancers. You have a higher risk if you have red or blond hair, fair skin, blue or green eyes, or sunburn easily, or if a close relative has had one.Melanomas are more common if you have periodic intense exposure to the sun.Other skin cancers are increasingly likely with long-term exposure.

②There is continuing debate as to how effective sunscreen is in reducing melanomas the evidence is weaker than it is for preventing other types of skin cancer.A 2011 Australian study of 1,621 people found that people randomly selected to apply sunscreen daily had half the rate of melanomas of people who used cream as needed. A second study, comparing 1,167 people with melanomas to 1,101 who didn't have the cancer, found that using sunscreen routinely, alongside other protection such as hats,long sleeves or staying in the shade, did give some protection.This study said other forms of sun protection- not sunscreen -seemed most beneficial.The study relied on people remembering what they had done over each decade of their lives, so it's not entirely reliable. But it seems reasonable to think sunscreen gives people a false sense of security in the sun.

③Many people also don't use sunscreen properly applying insufficient amounts, failing to reapply after a couple of hours and staying in the sun too long.It is sunburn that is most worrying recent research shows five episodes of sunburn in the teenage years increases the risk of all skin cancers.

④The good news is that a combination of sunscreen and covering up can reduce melanoma rates, as shown by Australian figures from their slip-slop-slap campaign.So if there is a heat wave this summer, it would be best for us, too, to slip on a shirt, slop on (抹上)sunscreen and slap on a hat.

如果您认为高指数防晒霜可以保护您免受有害射线的伤害，那么您可能就错了。本周的研究表明，虽然防晒指数50的防晒霜可以减少黑瘤的数量并延迟它们的发生，但它可以不能阻止它们的发生。黑色素瘤是最具攻击性的皮肤癌。如果你的头发是红色或金色，皮肤白皙，蓝色或绿色的眼睛，或容易晒伤，或者近亲患有此病，你的风险会更高。如果你经常暴露在阳光下，黑色素瘤更为常见。其他皮肤癌也越来越有可能发生。

关于防晒霜在减少黑色素瘤方面的效果仍然存在争论，比起预防其他类型的皮肤癌，其证据更加乏力。2011年澳大利亚对1,621人进行的一项研究发现，每天使用防晒霜的人患黑素瘤的比例是是需要时才使用面霜的人群的一半。第二项研究则将1167名患有黑色素瘤的人与1,101名未患癌症的人进行比较，发现常规使用防晒霜，以及帽子，长袖或阴凉处等其他保护措施，确实对这种疾病具有某些防护性。这项研究指出，其他形式的防晒措施-不是防晒霜-似乎更为有益。此研究依赖于人们记住他们在生命中的每个十年所采取防晒措施的记忆，因此它并不完全可靠。但是认为防晒霜给人们错误防晒意识似乎又是合理的。

许多人也没有正确使用防晒霜-用量不足、几小时后未能重新涂抹以及过长时间暴露于阳光下。晒伤才是最令人担忧的问题-最近的一项研究显示，青少年时期的五次晒伤经历会增加患所有皮肤癌的风险。

好消息是，正如澳大利亚人的“套上-涂上-扣上”运动的数据显示，综合使用防晒霜和遮盖物的组合可以降低黑色素瘤的发病率。所以如果今年夏天有热浪，对我们来说也是如此，穿上衬衫，抹上防晒霜，戴上帽子。
