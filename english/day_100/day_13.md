　　①Across the rich world, well-educated people increasingly work longer than the less-skilled. Some 65% of American men aged 62 -74 with a professional degree are in the workforce, compared with32% of men with only a high-school certificate.This gap is part of a deepening divide between the well-educated well-off and the unskilled poor.Rapid technological advance has raised the incomes of the highly skilled while squeezing those of the unskilled. The consequences, for individuals and society, are profound.

　　②The world is facing an astonishing rise in the number of old people, and they will live longer than ever before.Over the next 20 years the global population of those aged 65 or more will almost double, from 600 million to 1.1 billion.The experience of the 20th century, when greater longevity (长寿)translated into more years in retirement rather than more years at work, has persuaded many observers that this shift will lead to slower economic growth, while the swelling ranks of pensioners will create government budget problems. 

　　③But the notion of a sharp division between the working young and the idle old misses a new trend, the growing gap between the skilled and the unskilled.Employment rates are falling among younger unskilled people, whereas older skilled folk are working longer.The divide is most extreme in America, where well-educated baby-boomers (二战后生育高峰期出生的美国人)are putting off retirement while many less-skilled younger people have dropped out of the workforce.

　　④Policy is partly responsible.Many European governments have abandoned policies that used to encourage people to retire early.Rising life expectancy (预期寿命), combined with the replacement of generous defined-benefit pension plans with less generous defined-contribution ones, means that even the better-off must work longer to have a comfortable retirement. But the changing nature of work also plays a big role.Pay has risen sharply for the highly educated, and those people continue to reap rich rewards into old age because these days the educated elderly are more productive than the preceding generation.Technological change may well reinforce that shift: the skills that complement computers, from management know how to creativity, do not necessarily decline with age.

在富裕国家，与技术水平低的人相比，受过良好教育的人的工作时间越来越长。在62-74岁的具有专业学位的美国男性中，有65％仍然处在劳动大军中，而只有高中毕业证书的男性为32％尚在工作。这一差距正在不断加大受过良好教育的富人和无技术低收入穷人之间的分歧。快速的技术进步提高了高技能人员的收入，同时挤压了非技术人员的收入。对个人和社会而言，后果是深远的。

世界正面临着老年人数的惊人增长，他们将比以往任何时候都活得更久。在接下来的20年里，65岁或65岁以上人口的全球人口几乎翻了一番，从6亿增加到11亿。 20世纪，当长寿造成了退休生活的年份更长而不是工作的年份更长，这一经历使许多观察家相信这种转变将导致经济增长放缓，而养老金领取者的人数激增将导致政府预算问题。

但是，工作年轻人和闲散老年人之间急剧分化的概念错过了一个新趋势，技术人员和非技术人员之间的差距越来越大。年轻的非技术人员的就业率正在下降，而老年技术人员的工作时间更长。在美国最极端的地方，受过良好教育的婴儿潮一代正在推迟退休，而许多技术水平较低的年轻人已退出劳动力市场。

政策有部分责任。许多欧洲政府已经放弃了过去鼓励人们提前退休的政策。预期寿命的增加，加上慷慨的定额福利养老金计划被不再慷慨的定额缴费养老金计划所替代，意味着甚至富裕人士必须工作更长时间才能享受舒适的退休生活。但工作性质的变化也起着重要的作用。对于受过高等教育的人来说，工作报酬在大幅增加，而且这些人继续获得较高的收入，直到老年，因为当的老龄高学历人群比上一代人工作更有成效。技术变革可能会加强这种转变：作为计算机的补充技能从管理知识到创造力，不会随着年龄的增长而下降。
