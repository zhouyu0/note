A recent global survey of 2,000 high-net-worth individuals found that 60% were not planning on a traditional retirement. Among U.S. participants, 75% expected to continue working in some capacity even after stepping away from full-time jobs. “Many of these people made their wealth by doing something they’re passionate (有激情的) about,” says Daniel Egan, head of behavioral finance for Barclays Wealth Americas. “Given the choice, they prefer to continue working.” Barclays calls these people “nevertirees.”
　　Unlike many Americans compelled into early retirement by company restrictions, the average nevertiree often has no one forcing his hand. If 106-year-old investor Irving Kahn, head of his own family firm, wants to keep coming to work every day, who’s going to stop him? Seventy-eight-year-old Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s job security is guaranteed in the Constitution.
　　It may seem that these elderly people are trying to cheat death. In fact, they are. And it’s working. Howard Friedman, a professor at UC Riverside, found in his research that those who work hardest and are successful in their careers often live the longest lives. “People are generally being given bad advice to slow down, take it easy, stop worrying, and retire to Florida,” he says. He described one study participant, still working at the age of 100, who was recently disappointed to see his son retire.
　 “We’re beginning to see a change in how people view retirement,” says George Leeson, co-director of the Institute of Population Ageing at Oxford. Where once retirement was seen as a brief reward after a long struggle through some miserable job, it is now akin (近似) to being cast aside. What Leeson terms “the Warren Buffett effect” is becoming more broadly appealing as individuals come to “view retirement as not simply being linked to economic productivity but also about contribution.”
　Observers are split on whether this is a wholly good thing. On the one hand, companies and financial firms can benefit from the wisdom of a resilient (坚韧的) chief. On the other, the new generation can find it more difficult to advance—an argument that typically holds little sway to a nevertiree.

最近一项由2 000位高净值客户参与的全球范围的调查发现,60%的人并未打算正常退休。参与此项调查的美国人中,75%的人希望从全职工作退休之后能尽其所能继续工作。(56)"这些人当中有很多是通过去做自己感兴趣的事情来获取财富的,"美洲巴克莱财富行为财务主管Daniel Egan说如果能自由选择,他们更愿意继续工作下去。"巴克莱把这些人称为"永不退休者"。

与很多根据公司规定不得不提前退休的美国人不同，对"永不退休者"来说,没人能强迫他们退休。(57)现在106岁的投资家Irving Kahn是家族企业的老总,如果他想坚持每天到公司上班,谁会阻止他呢？《美国宪法》保证现年78岁高龄的最高法院法官Ruth Bader Ginsburg的工作安全。

这些老年人似乎是正在尝试逃避死亡。事实确实如此,并且这也的确起到了一定的作用。(58)加州大学河滨分校的教授Howard Friedman的研究表明,工作最努力和事业上有所成就的人通常活得最长。"人们通常被建议要慢下来,放轻松,不要着急,然后退休去佛罗里达,这种建议其实不好，"他说。他还描 述了一位受调查者.尽管100岁的高龄但仍然坚持工作,最近看到自己的儿子退休感觉很失望。

牛津人口老龄化研究所主任George Leeson说我们发现人们对待退休的态度开始发生变化。" (59)过去,人们曾认为退休是他们在某个令人痛苦的工作岗位上长期奋斗后的即时奖励,而现在人们认为 退休与被遗弃类似。随着人们开始意识到"退休不仅仅是简单地与经济生产力相联系,而且也关乎贡献 Leeson提出的-沃伦•巴菲特效应"也越来越流行。

(60)关于这是否完全是一件好事情,评论家们各持己见。一方面,企业和金融公司可以受益于坚韧的领导人的智慧。另一方面,下一代人要想进一步发展会更加困难, 但是这一点对于一个"永不退休者"来说 影响不大。
