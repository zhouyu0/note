①The question of whether our government should promote science and technology or the liberal arts in higher education isn’t an either/or proposition(命题)，although the current emphasis on preparing young Americans for STEM（science, technology, engineering, maths）-related fields can make it seem that way.

②The latest congressional report acknowledges the critical importance of technical training, but also asserts that the study of the humanities (人文学科)and social sciences must remain central components of America’s educational system at all levels.Both are critical to producing citizens who can participate effectively in our democratic society, become innovative（创新的)leaders, and benefit from the spiritual enrichment that the reflection on the great ideas of mankind over time provides.

③Parents and students who have invested heavily in higher education worry about graduates’ job prospects as technological advances and changes in domestic and global markets transform professions in ways that reduce wages and cut jobs. Under these circumstances, it’s natural to look for what may appear to be the most “practical” way out of the problem “Major in a subject designed to get you a job” seems the obvious answer to some, though this ignores the fact that many disciplines in the humanities characterized as“soft”often, in fact, lead to employment and success in the long run. Indeed, according to surveys, employer shave expressed a preference for students who have received a broadly-based education that has taught them to write well, think critically, research creatively, and communicate easily.

④Moreover, students should be prepared not just for their first job, but for their 4th and 5th jobs, as there’s little reason to doubt that people entering the workforce today will be called upon to play many different roles over the course of their careers. The ones who will do the best in this new environment will be those whose educations have prepared them to be flexible. The ability to draw upon every available tool and insight—picked up from science, arts, and technology—to solve the problems of the future, and take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves, will be helpful to them and the United States.

①我们的政府是否应该在高等教育中推广科学技术或文科的问题不是一道选择题，尽管目前的重点是为年轻的美国人准备STEM（科学，技术，工程，数学）- 相关领域的科目可以使它看起来像是要那样做。

②最新的国会报告承认技术培训的至关重要性，但也断言人文科学和社会科学的研究必须仍然是美国各级教育系统的核心组成部分。两者都对于培养能够有效参与民主社会，成为创新型领导者的公民至关重要，并且能够从人类伟大思想随着时间的推移所提供的丰富精神财富中获益。

③在高等教育方面投入巨资的父母和学生担心毕业生的就业前景，因为技术进步和国内及全球市场的变化会以降低工资和裁员的方式改变职业。在这种情况下，很自然地寻找可能看起来最“实用”的方法来解决问题“一个旨在让你找到工作的主题”似乎是一些明显的答案，尽管这忽略了很多事实。事实上，人文学科中的“软”学科往往会带来就业和长期成功。事实上，根据调查，雇主已经表示倾向于那些接受过广泛教育的学生，这些学生具备良好的写作能力，批判性思维，创造性研究和轻松交流的能力。

④而且，学生不仅应该为第一份工作做好准备，还要为第四和第五份工作做好准备，因为没有理由怀疑今天进入劳动力市场的人将被要求在其职业生涯中扮演许多不同的角色。那些在这种新环境中将做到最好的人将是那些其教育使他们变得灵活的人。能够利用每一种可用的工具和从科学，艺术和技术中获得的洞察力来解决未来的问题，并利用自身的机会，这将有助于他们和美国的发展。
