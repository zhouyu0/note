#### 原文

　　The wallet is heading for extinction. As a day-to-day essential, it will die off with the generation who read print newspapers. The kind of shopping-where you hand over notes and count out change in return—now happens only in the most minor of our retail encounters，like buying a bar of chocolate or a pint of milk from a comer shop. At the shops where you spend any real money, that money is increasingly abstracted. And this is more and more true, the higher up the scale you go. At the most cutting-edge retail stores—Victoria Beckham on Dover Street, for instance—you don’t go and stand at any kind of cash register when you decide to pay. The staff are equipped with iPads to take your payment while you relax on a sofa.

　　Which is nothing more or less than excellent service, if you have the money. But across society, the abstraction of the idea of cash makes me uneasy. Maybe I’m just old-fashioned. But earning money isn’t quick or easy for most of us. Isn’t it a bit weird that spending it should happen in half a blink (眨眼) of an eye? Doesn’t a wallet—that time-honoured Friday-night feeling of pleasing, promising fatness—represent something that matters?

　　But I’ll leave the economics to the experts. What bothers me about the death of the wallet is the change it represents in our physical environment. Everything about the look and feel of a wallet—the way the fastenings and materials wear and tear and loosen with age, the plastic and paper and gold and silver, and handwritten phone numbers and printed cinema tickets—is the very opposite of what our world is becoming. The opposite of a wallet is a smartphone of an iPad. The rounded edges, cool glass, smooth and unknowable as pebble (鹅卵石). Instead of digging through pieces of paper and peering into corners, we move our fingers left and right. No more counting out coins. Show your wallet, if you still have one. It may not be here much longer.

#### 翻译

钱包即将灭绝。作为日常必需品，它将与阅读印刷报纸的一代人一同消亡。这种购物 - 你交出笔记并计算回报的变化 - 现在只发生在我们极少的零售业中，比如从一家商店买一条巧克力或一品脱牛奶。在你花费任何真钱的商店里，这笔钱越来越抽象。这越来越真实，你的规模越高。例如，在多佛街上最前沿的零售商店 - 维多利亚贝克汉姆 - 当你决定付款时，你不会站在任何一种收银机前。工作人员配备了iPad，您可以在沙发上放松身心。

如果你有钱的话，这不过是优质的服务。但是在整个社会中，现金概念的抽象让我感到不安。也许我只是老式的人。但对我们大多数人来说，赚钱并不快捷。花费它在半眨眼（眨眼）的情况下发生是不是有点奇怪？钱包代表了什么重要的事情吗？ - 比如时间宝贵的周五晚上让人愉悦的感觉，或是有前途的肥胖感？

但我会把经济学留给专家。令我困扰的是钱包的死亡是它在我们的物理环境中所代表的变化。关于钱包外观和感觉的一切 - 紧固件和材料随着年龄的增长而磨损和松动的方式，塑料和纸张以及金银，手写电话号码和印刷电影票 - 正变成与我们的世界正好相反。钱包的另一面是iPad的智能手机。圆润的边缘，凉爽的玻璃，光滑和不可知的鹅卵石（鹅卵石）。我们不是左右移动纸张并窥视角落，而是左右移动手指。不再计算硬币了。如果你还有钱包，请出示你的钱包。它可能不会在这里更长。
