①Energy independence. It has a nice ring to it. Doesn’t it? If you think so, you’re not alone, because energy independence has been the dream of American president for decades, and never more so than in the past few years, when the most recent oil price shock has been partly responsible for kicking off the great recession.

②“Energy independence” and its rhetorical (修辞的) companion “energy security” are, however, slippery concepts that are rarely thought through. What is it we want independence from, exactly?

③Most people would probably say that they want to be independent from imported oil. But there are reasons that we buy all that oil from elsewhere.

④The first reason is that we need it to keep our economy running. Yes, there is a trickle（涓涓细流）of biofuel（生物燃料）available, and more may become available, but most biofuels cause economic waste and environmental destruction.

⑤Second, Americans have basically decided that they don’t really want to produce all their own oil. They value the environmental quality they preserve over their oil imports from abroad.Vast areas of the United States are off-limits to oil exploration and production in the name of environmental protection. To what extent are Americans really willing to endure the environmental impacts of domestic energy production in order to cut back imports?

⑥Third, there are benefits to trade. It allows for economic efficiency, and when we buy things from places that have lower production costs than we do, we benefit. And although you don’t read about this much, the United States is also a large exporter of oil products, selling about 2 million barrels of petroleum products per day to about 90 countries.

⑦There is no question that the United States imports a great deal of energy and, in fact, relies on that steady flow to maintain its economy. When that flow is interrupted, we feel the pain in short supplies and higher prices, At the same time, we derive massive economic benefits when we buy the most affordable energy on the world market and when we engage in energy trade around the world.

61. What does the author say about energy independence for America?		A
A) It sounds very attractive.
B) It ensures national security.
C) It will bring oil prices down.
D) It has long been everyone’s dream.

A) They keep America’s economy running healthily.
B) They prove to be a good alternative to petroleum.
C) They do not provide a sustainable energy supply.
D) They cause serious damage to the environment.

63. Why does America rely heavily on oil imports?		C
A) It wants to expand its storage of crude oil.
B) Its own oil reserves are quickly running out.
C) It wants to keep its own environment intact.
D) Its own oil production falls short of demand.

64. What does the author say about oil trade?		B

能源独立。这是一件好事，不是吗？如果你这么认为，你并不孤单，因为能源独立几十年来一直是美国总统的梦想，而且在过去几年中，当石油价格冲击已经成为导致大萧条的部分原因时，这种想法最为强烈。

然而，“能源独立”及其修辞性的说法“能源安全”是很模糊的概念。究竟是什么让我们想要独立？

大多数人可能会说他们希望独立于进口石油。但我们要从其他地方购买石油的原因何其之多。

第一个原因是我们需要进口石油来保持经济运行。是的，确实由少量生物燃料可供使用，而且可能会越来越多，但大多数生物燃料会造成经济浪费和环境破坏。

其次，美国人基本上已经决定他们并不真的想要自己生产所有的石油。他们重视从国外进口石油，从而保护环境质量。以环境保护的名义，美国的大部分地区禁止石油勘探和生产。美国人在多大程度上真的愿意忍受国内能源生产对环境的影响，以减少进口？

第三，贸易有利。它可以提高经济效益，当我们从生产成本低于我们的地方购买东西时，我们会受益。虽然你可能对此不太了解，但美国也是石油产品的大出口国，每天向约90个国家出售约200万桶石油产品。

毫无疑问，美国进口大量能源，事实上，美国是以此稳流来维持经济。当这种流动中断时，我们会感受到供应短缺和价格上涨带来的痛苦。与此同时，当我们在世界市场上购买最实惠的能源以及我们在全球范围内从事能源贸易时，我们可以获得巨大的经济效益。
